Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",

Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",

Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",
