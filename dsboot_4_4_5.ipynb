      "Vigil strange I kept on the field one night ; When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day , One look I but gave which your dear eyes return ' d with a look I shall never forget , One touch of your hand to mine O boy , reach ' d up as you lay on the ground , Then onward I sped in the battle , the even - contested battle , Till late in the night reliev ' d to the place at last again I made my way , Found you in death so cold dear comrade , found your body son of responding kisses , ( never again on earth responding ,) Bared your face in the starlight , curious the scene , cool blew the moderate night - wind , Long there and then in vigil I stood , dimly around me the battlefield spreading , Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night , But not a tear fell , not even a long - drawn sigh , long , long I gazed , Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands , Passing sweet hours , immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade  not a tear , not a word , Vigil of silence , love and death , vigil for you my son and my soldier , As onward silently stars aloft , eastward new ones upward stole , Vigil final for you brave boy , ( I could not save you , swift was your death , I faithfully loved you and cared for you living , I think we shall surely meet again ,) Till at latest lingering of the night , indeed just as the dawn appear ' d , My comrade I wrapt in his blanket , envelop ' d well his form , Folded the blanket well , tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet , And there and then and bathed by the rising sun , my son in his grave , in his rude - dug grave I deposited , Ending my vigil strange with that , vigil of night and battle - field dim , Vigil for boy of responding kisses , ( never again on earth responding ,) Vigil for comrade swiftly slain , vigil I never forget , how as day brighten ' d , I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket , And buried him where he fell .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.452042\n",

      "When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv ' d with plaudits in the capitol , still it was not a happy night for me that follow ' d , And else when I carous ' d , or when my plans were accomplish ' d , still I was not happy , But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health , refresh ' d , singing , inhaling the ripe breath of autumn , When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light , When I wander ' d alone over the beach , and undressing bathed , laughing with the cool waters , and saw the sun rise , And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming , O then I was happy , O then each breath tasted sweeter , and all that day my food nourish ' d me more , and the beautiful day pass ' d well , And the next came with equal joy , and with the next at evening came my friend , And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores , I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me , For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night , In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me , And his arm lay lightly around my breast  and that night I was happy .

      "What best I see in thee , Is not that where thou mov ' st down history ' s great highways , Ever undimm ' d by time shoots warlike victory ' s dazzle , Or that thou sat ' st where Washington

lands , in all thy walks with kings , Those prairie sovereigns of the West , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Ohio ' s , Indiana ' s millions , comrades , farmers , soldiers , all to the front ,
